            <p>My name is Bryan Brugal, I'm a sofware developer based in United States, New York. When I'm not coding, I'm usually 
                trading stocks, watching a film, ice skating, exercising, playing or watching basketball, reading 
                about all things tech and finance or eating and drinking my weight in coffee and pastries.
            </p>

            <p>One of my skills is designing programs with python. I have an associate degree in computer science, and 
                currently I'm a junior student at Lehman College doing a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
                I have taken several programming courses such as Data structure, mobile programming, artificial 
                intelligence, ect.</p>
           
            <p>I am taking CMP 128 because I believe that having a website is no longer a luxury, it is now a 
                necessity. A website today is a global means of communication to the needs required by people 
                who surf the Internet.</p>

            <p>I enjoy working with code, and trying new technologies. This year, I'm looking to further 
                my knowledge in web development learning Html, Css, Node.js, React, Redux, JQuery, Bootstrap, 
                JavaScript, and Django. 
            </p>
            
            <p>I’m interested in new and exciting projects and opportunities so feel free to get in touch!</p>
